# A Computer Geometry Bibliography
This is a bibliography covering computer representations and processing of geometry, including CAGD (Computer-Aided Geometric Design), solid modeling, computational geometry, and related fields. The material should be of interest to CAGD researchers as well as people developing CAD/CAM/CAE software, games, drawing programs, and so on. 

The bibliography is a single large text file containing around 25,000 entries in the .bib format used by TeX/LaTeX. It includes, among other things:
  - All papers published in the journal Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) through 2022.
  - All geometry-centric papers published in the journal Computer-Aided Design (CAD) through 2022.
  - All the papers I could find by a few of my favorite authors in the field, gathered from DBLP. 
  - All the entries from a CAGD bibliography created by Andreas Muller, last updated in 1998.
  - A large bibliography compiled by Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford (kindly provided by Dianne).
  - References from Rida Farouki's book on Pythagorean Hodograph curves (thank you, Rida).

There are several tools for browsing/filtering/searching .bib files. I use one called JabRef, which you can find here: http://www.jabref.org/.

I have been accumulating this stuff for years, and have forgotten many of the sources. Apologies if I stood on your shoulders but failed to mention you. I created the bibliography for my own use, but I'm publishing it here so that other people can benefit from it (and add to it, also, I hope).

If you want to contribute, you can just email additions/modifications to me (bubbakittee) via my gmail address. The email address is obvious, I hope. Please let me know if you want your contributions to be anonymous.

Alternatively, to contribute using git and/or github, use the standard process ...
  - Fork this repository (e.g. with upper right button on github)
  - Add new entries or modifications in the file: ComputerGeometryBibliography.bib
  - Issue a pull request asking for your changes to be pulled into the master repository
